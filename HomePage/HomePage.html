                        <div>Description: For this first lab, we had to re-create a website that was already created, but change the background 
                        to an image. In this lab, I learned the basics of html, such as creating and styling a table,
                        adding a image/background image, how to style the font, and how to format text on a web page.

                        <div>Description:For this assignment, I had to create my own website on a CS topic of interest. 
                        The topic I decided was Powered Exoskeleton and its website contains an Overview, History, Reference, 
                        Societal Benefits, and Contact pages. I implemented my knowlegde from Lab One in this Assignment. </div>

                        <div>Description: In this lab, I learned how to manipulate a table to ssscreate LED text.
                        For this lab, the program takes in a word and sorts through the letters, printing out each letters
                        as an LED letter, with a randomly chosen color. This program can also take in a word and print it out as
                        an LED with a random color in each cell of the letter.</div>

                        <div>Description:For this assignment, I had to create a PHP file of any kind and follow certain guidelines
                        In this assignment, I had to use at least two loops, include at least two conditions, 
                        use at least 15 CSS rules in an external file, use the rand() function, use at least two images,
                        use at least one array, and use at least three array functions. 
                        I decided for this movie, I would simulate a random movie picker. The program begins with nine preset movies
                        and randomly chooses three of the movies for the user to watch. The program then puts the 3 movies in a random order
                        for the user to watch in. </div>

                        <div>Description: In this lab, we had to work in partners to re-create the game, Silverjack. For this game, we had to assign each of the players
                        a random number of random cards from 4 to 6 cards each without any of the cards repeating, we had to give the cards a number value, and then we had to add up the scores 
                        of each of the four players and determine the winner. The player with the resulting score of 42, or the score closest to 42 while still being under 42 is the winner. The 
                        program then displays the winner and gives the option of playing again with the same players, or typing in new player names. </div>

                        program then displays the user's name, the products they purchased, and the total price for all of the products they purchased. </div>
